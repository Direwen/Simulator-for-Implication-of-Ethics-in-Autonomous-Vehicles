# Autonomous Vehicle Ethics Simulator üöó‚öñÔ∏è  

The **Autonomous Vehicle Ethics Simulator** is a research-focused project designed to visualize and evaluate ethical decision-making scenarios in autonomous vehicles. By simulating real-world situations, this tool explores how AVs can navigate complex moral dilemmas.  

Additionally, this project serves as a submission for the **Computing Research Project** subject in the HND program. The research, titled **"The Implication of Ethics in Autonomous Vehicles"**, aims to study the ethical considerations AVs must address and provide a practical demonstration through this simulator.

### **Scenario-Based Simulations üóÅÔ∏è**
- Experience multiple ethical scenarios visualized through engaging simulations.  
- Each scenario showcases a unique moral dilemma faced by autonomous vehicles.  
- Explore how AVs make decisions under varying constraints and contexts.

### **Dynamic Visualization üé•**
- Six pre-configured ethical scenarios, each represented as animated simulations:  
  - **Case 1**  
    ![Case 1](https://github.com/Direwen/Simulator-for-Implication-of-Ethics-in-Autonomous-Vehicles/blob/main/src/assets/case1.gif?raw=true)  
  - **Case 2**
